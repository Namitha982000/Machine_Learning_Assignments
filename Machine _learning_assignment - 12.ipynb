    "Prior probability, also known as prior belief or prior distribution, refers to the initial probability assigned to an event or hypothesis before any specific evidence or information is taken into account.

    "An example of prior probability can be illustrated with a medical scenario. Let's say a doctor is evaluating a patient who has a certain set of symptoms, and the doctor suspects that the patient may have a specific rare disease. However, the doctor knows that the prevalence of this disease in the general population is very low, let's say 1 in 10,000 people.\n",
